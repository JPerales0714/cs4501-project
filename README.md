# CS4501 Project - Used Clothing App

## Notes

- The Django project itself is called uc_app (used clothing app), and it's folder (/uc_app/uc_app/) contains the various project-wide settings and references to all associated applications.

- Once you pull the repository down, you'll want to create your web container (probably under ~/RepositoryDirectory), and be sure to link it to any running SQL images you have that you did in project one. The database settings should match the ones we used for Project 1! 

- Most, if not all editing of files should happen within /uc_app/v1 (v1 = version 1) - this is the first web application. It will contain our pre-defined models and everything that goes along with them. It doesn't currently have a urls file but I'll add one once I need to link things.

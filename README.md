# CS4501 Project - Used Clothing App

## Updated User Stories fro Project 4:

Users should be able to..
- Create accounts with unique usernames.
- Log-in to the website to post items for sale.
- Log-out of the website.
- Create new listings while logged in.
- Get visual feedback if their action is illegal (logging in when already logged in, trying to post an item without being properly authenticated).
- Get feedback if their forms for item creation are invalid. (and how to fix it)
